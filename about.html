      Pardesi Consultancy is built on one simple belief — <strong>real guidance comes from real experience.</strong>
      As a husband-and-wife team, we personally walked the same path you are dreaming of today. From leaving India as
      international students to navigating studies, work permits, financial struggles, visas, approvals,
      and finally permanent residency — we lived the Canadian journey deeply and honestly.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Story & Mission</h2>

      <p class="text-sm text-[#5b403a] leading-relaxed mb-6">
        We — <strong>Pooja Tiwari</strong> and <strong>Sahil Vashisht</strong> — came to Canada as international students
        with big dreams, limited information, and the same fears and doubts many students and families face today.
        We struggled through paperwork, immigration rules, financial challenges, course choices, job searches, and the
        uncertainty of starting life in a new country.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm text-[#5b403a] leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Going through each step ourselves taught us what no website, agent, or checklist ever explains —
        <strong>the real-life side of the process.</strong> We learned what works, what doesn’t, and how one wrong move
        can delay your dreams. Over the years, Sahil secured Permanent Residency in Canada, and together we built a
        strong understanding of the Canadian immigration and education system from real experience — not theory.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm text-[#5b403a] leading-relaxed">
        Today, we use that knowledge to help others avoid mistakes, choose the right path, and make confident decisions.
        Whether you want to study, work, or build a long-term future in Canada, our guidance comes from a place of
        honesty, clarity, and lived experience. We treat every client like family — because we know exactly what it feels
        like to be in your shoes.
